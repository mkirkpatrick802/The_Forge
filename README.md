#### ABOUT
I want this engine to focus on 2D pixel art games that provides lots of tools for sprite editing and network programming. My favorite games are multiplayer and pixel art based, and I would like a tool that makes it quick and easy for me to make games of these genres. This engine will be built in C++ and the build system will be using Premake and Lua.
